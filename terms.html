                                   services that may contain bugs, defects, and errors. In exchange for the licenses granted to Evaluator to use such software, products, applications,

                                    and evaluate the Services in live operations, and to promptly report to CareerPoint, either orally or in writing, any errors, problems, defects,
                                     or suggestions for changes and improvements to the Services (collectively, “Feedback”). Evaluator acknowledges and agrees that all Feedback and
                                      all intellectual property rights therein are the exclusive property of CareerPoint, and hereby assigns to CareerPoint, all right, title and 
                                      interest to any and all Feedback. Further, Evaluator acknowledges and agrees that Feedback may be used by CareerPoint in CareerPoint’s 
                                      development of and be incorporated into a version of the Services CareerPoint may make available for commercial distribution 
                                      (“Commercial Release”) or any other software or intellectual property created by CareerPoint. Without limiting the foregoing,
                                       CareerPoint may incorporate Feedback into its products and services and Evaluator will gain no rights in such products or services by virtue
                                        of having disclosed Feedback. Evaluator agrees and acknowledges that the products and services incorporating such Feedback will be the sole 
                                        and exclusive property of CareerPoint, and Evaluator will gain no right, title or interest in or to the Services or any Commercial Release
                                         by virtue of Evaluator’s provision of Feedback to CareerPoint or for any other reason. CareerPoint has no obligation to create, distribute 
                                         or otherwise offer a Commercial Release, and in the event of such Commercial Release, CareerPoint has no obligation to offer the Commercial 
                                         Release to Evaluator or to offer Evaluator any discounted pricing schedules or special terms. Evaluator understands and agrees that the
                                          Commercial Release may contain functions and functionality, and perform in a manner significantly different from the current beta version 
                                          of the Services. Accordingly, Evaluator acknowledges that any research or development performed, or business plans made, by Evaluator 
                                          regarding or in reliance upon the Services are done entirely at Evaluator’s own risk.</p>

                              <p>“A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or 
                                   suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected
                                    his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” The foregoing release does not apply to any claims, demands, or any losses, damages,
                                     rights and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death or property damage for any unconscionable commercial practice by a
                                      CareerPoint Party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false, promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any 
                                      material fact in connection with the Services provided hereunder.
                                 General Provisions.?</p>

                              <p>This Agreement will be governed by the laws of State of Delaware, without reference to conflicts of law principles. 
                                   In the event of a dispute regarding any matter under this Agreement, each party agrees to first make diligent and commercially reasonable efforts 
                                   to resolve such dispute amicably with the other party. To the extent the dispute is not resolved in fifteen (15) days, the parties agree that
                                    any dispute regarding this Agreement shall then be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in the State of Delaware, and each
                                     party hereby agrees to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Evaluator may not assign or transfer,
                                      by operation of law, change of control or otherwise, any of its rights under this Agreement to any third party without CareerPoint’s
                                       prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be void. All waivers must be in writing. 
                                       Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of 
                                       such provision on any other occasion. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the 
                                       balance of this Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any 
                                       reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain enforceable and the invalid or unenforceable 
                                       provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Agreement may be executed 
                                       in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which will be taken together and deemed to be one instrument</p>
